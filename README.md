ICE CART VR - a virtual reality gamified simulator for vehicle physics and road conditions 

ICVR is made mainly in unity utilizing c# as the main programming language. The majority of the project and assets are made by the team (very few third party assets were used). ICVR can be played with: mouse and keyboard, a ps4 or xbox 360/one controller or a logitech G29 steering wheel + a driving force shifter. 

Our group had a lot of free reign over the project but we had a few features that were required to be in the finished product. These things are: Different road conditions (ice, dirt, tarmac), 3rd and 1st person view, VR compatible (HTC Vive), many different input devices (listed above), different vehicle configurations and force feedback from the g29 steering wheel.

Our group is called Guild Goals and its comprised of 5 people:
Sandra Andersson
Carl Appelkvist
Anton Jonsson
Kristoffer Lundgren
Benjamin Westerlund

ICVR have multiple input devices (listed above) but only some software is required depending on if you have the built version or is just playing/working on the game in Unity. 

The software needed to play the built game are:
Steam + SteamVR (if you play in virtual reality)
Logitech gaming software (if you use the logitech peripherals)

The software needed to edit or run the program in Unity are:
Steam + SteamVR
Logitech Steering wheel SDK
Logitech gaming software
Blender
Unity

(All of these softwares are needed, if they are not present the project will crash and/or donâ€™t work.)

Also take a look at the projects wiki for more information.
